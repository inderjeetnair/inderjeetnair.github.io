I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computational and Data Sciences (CDS) at the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://www.iisc.ac.in/) with a research focus on Machine Learning and related areas. I am supervised by [Prof. Partha Pratim Talukdar](http://talukdar.net/), and have been affiliated with the Machine And Language Learning Lab (MALL Lab) since August 2018.

Prior to graduate school, I received my Bachelor of Engineering (BE Hons.) in Computer Science from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (BITS Pilani)](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) in 2015.

## Research

I am broadly interested in machine learning, data mining, natural language processing and related fields. In my post-graduate work, I have had a specific focus on knowledge graphs (KG) and question answering. In this area, I have tried to improve QA performance by combining pre-trained language models with KG embeddings. I have also worked on making KG embeddings more scalable and easier to apply to downstream tasks.
During my undergraduate studies I worked on humanoid robotics and computer vision.
