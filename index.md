I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/), working under the guidance of [Prof. Lu Wang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wangluxy/). I am currently focussing on using LLMs for Argument Mining. Prior to that, I was a Research Associate at [Adobe Research Labs, Bangalore](https://research.adobe.com/careers/bangalore/) where I worked on a wide range of Machine Learning projects in Document intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Information Extraction and Legal Artificial Intelligence. I recieved my Bachelor of Technology (BTech.) in Electrical Engineering with Minor in Computer Science and Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT Bombay)](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 2021. In my spare time, I enjoy gaming, reading non-fiction books, and playing sports like badminton and squash.


## Research

I am broadly interested in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and related fields. Currently, I am exploring how LLMs can be employed in effectively extracting the argumentative structure of the text, all with the objective of providing invaluable feedback to students regarding their essay compositions. At Adobe, I have primarily worked in document intelligence projects involving NLP techniques like semantic / topical structure analysis and information extraction. During my undergraduate studies, I worked with [Prof. Suyash Awate](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash/index.html#teaching) to repurpose a generative modelling framework for the task of one-class classification and anomaly detection. Under the guidance of [Prof. Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/), I worked in developing a PAC algorithm for mode estimation of discrete distribution with efficient sample complexity.
