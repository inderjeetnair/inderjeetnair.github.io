I am currently a third-year Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/), working under the guidance of [Prof. Lu Wang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wangluxy/). My current work centers on investigating, reducing, and assessing potential scheming and deceptive behaviors in language technologies that can emerge from prevailing alignment methods. Concurrently, I am also exploring how we can generate complex function / api calling datapoints using LLMs that involve complex interdependent long trajectories of api executions with the hope of using these datapoints to improve and evaluating the existing technologies. Previously, I investigated applications of LLMs in education, structured commonsense reasoning, and the evaluation of consistency in their value preferences. Prior to that, I was a Research Associate at [Adobe Research Labs, Bangalore](https://research.adobe.com/careers/bangalore/) where I worked on a wide range of Machine Learning projects in Document intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Information Extraction and Legal Artificial Intelligence. I recieved my Bachelor of Technology (BTech.) in Electrical Engineering with Minor in Computer Science and Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT Bombay)](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 2021. In my spare time, I enjoy gaming, reading non-fiction books, and playing sports like badminton and squash.


## Research

I am broadly interested in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and related fields. Currently, I am exploring how LLMs can be employed in effectively extracting the argumentative structure of the text, all with the objective of providing invaluable feedback to students regarding their essay compositions. Currently, I am exploring how potential deceptive and scheming behavior can emerge in current language technologies during the alignment process. During my internship at Bloomberg, I explored the problem of generating complex function / api calling datapoints for improving and evaluating the tool calling abilities of LLMs. At Adobe, I have primarily worked in document intelligence projects involving NLP techniques like semantic / topical structure analysis and information extraction. During my undergraduate studies, I worked with [Prof. Suyash Awate](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash/index.html#teaching) to repurpose a generative modelling framework for the task of one-class classification and anomaly detection. Under the guidance of [Prof. Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/), I worked in developing a PAC algorithm for mode estimation of discrete distribution with efficient sample complexity.
